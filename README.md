First, Click the star above for this GitHub repository! :)

Radiomics is a field that involves extracting large amounts of quantitative features from medical images using data-characterization algorithms. These features, known as radiomics features, can be used for various applications such as diagnosing diseases, predicting outcomes, or assessing response to therapy.

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to supply a foundational educational tool for conducting radiomics research, particularly emphasizing the relationship between radiological imaging features and patient outcomes in glioblastoma cases. This repository hosts a computational framework meant to process and examine datasets comprising various radiomics parameters, such as tumor volume, texture, and intensity variations extracted from MRI images.
